Works: annotations/analysis for articles 5-7 and the 10 amendments. helped with decision to toggle analysis.

I ran into some problems when trying to analyze the 10 amendments, as they are very short. To solve this problem, I gave examples and the reasoning as to why they were implemented.

We decided as a group to make a toggle function to hide or show the annotation blocks that included our analysis.
